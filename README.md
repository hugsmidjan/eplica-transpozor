# Eplica Transpozor

Content transposing plugin manager for Eplica's Inline WYSIWYG Editor.

The Eplica Transpozor manages the lifecycle of specially written Eplica Inline Editor [plugins][] that know how to search for specific HTML content, replace it with purpose-built structured editing interface, and then transform back to static HTML format when the user hits "Save" in the editor.



## Usage.

The transpozor depends on the `EPLICA` global object being defined, and containing the `inlineEditor` object.  (Both those conditions are automatically met when Eplica Webmasters are logged in.)

In a website's `editorStylingRules.js` file add the import the transpozor:

```js
import transpozor from 'eplica-transpozor';
```

Then use the `.addPlugin()` method to register any transpozor [plugins][] you have written.

```js
import { myPlugin, myPlugin2, myPlugin3 } from './_js/myplugins';

transpozor
    .addPlugin( myPlugin );
transpozor
    .addPlugin( myPlugin2 )
    .addPlugin( myPlugin3 );
```

(Note the optional chaining API.)



## Custom Events

The transpozor automatically looks for the `EPLICA.inlineEditor` and does the neccessary event bindings when `.addPlugin` is called for the first time, so no further configuration is required. (FWIW, the transpozor object also exposes itself as `EPLICA.inlineEditor.transpozor`.)

Finally, you can use the `.on()` method to bind custom event-handlers to the `start` and `end` of the transposing life-cycle.

```js
transpozor
    .on('start', function (e) {
        // e.editElm (The current inline-editor element)
        // e.transposeElms (Array of HTML elements about to be transposed)
      })
    .on('end', function (e) {
        // e.editElm (The current inline-editor element)
        // e.transposeElms (Array of HTML elements that were just transposed)
      });
```

The `start` event triggers as the Inline Editor is starting, just before the transpozor searches each inline-editor element for transposable content.

The `end` event triggers for each inline-editor element early in the Save phase, as soon as the transposing editing UIs have been converted back to its final HTML form.



## Injecting New Transpose Widgets

A user may want to insert a new/empty transpozor widget into an active Editing zone.

This is most commonly done via the Inline Editor's toolbar as a "HTML Snippet" ("Greinaklippur") similar to this:

```html
<img src="https://eplica-cdn.is/f/e2-w.png"
    data-transpozor-insert="myPluginId"
    onload="EPLICA.inlineEditor.transpozor.rescan()" />
```

...but it can also be done programatically, like so:

```js
var widgetMarker = document.createElement('div');
widgetMarker.setAttribute('data-transpozor-insert', 'myPluginId');
editElm.appendChild( widgetMarker );
transpozor.rescan();
```



## Advanced Usage

If you want to manually control when the transpozor registers with the inline-editor (i.e. not wait until `.addPlugin()` is first called), you must call the `.registerWithEditor()` method. (and optionally feed it a custom editor instance).

```js
transpozor
    .registerWithEditor();

editor.addEvent('EditorOpen', someOpenHandler);
editor.addEvent('SaveStart', someSaveHandler);

transpozor
    .on('start', eventHandler)
    .addPlugin( myPlugin );
```

This allows control over when the transpozor's  `start` and `end` events trigger in relation to normal Inline-Editor life-cycle event handlers.

You can also optionally feed `.registerWithEditor` a custom editor instance â€“ if you don't want it to use the default `EPLICA.inlineEditor` global.

```js
transpozor
    .registerWithEditor( EplicaEditorRef );
```

Please note, that repeat calls to `.registerWithEditor()` are simply ignored.
